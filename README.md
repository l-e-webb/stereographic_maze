# Stereographic Maze

Stereographic Maze is part math visualization, part simple puzzle game. Navigate a maze on the surface of the sphere, with the maze viewed in the plane via [stereographic projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection). You start at the south pole. The goal is to reach the north pole, which is marked with a dot.

The current version is a prototype. Features coming soon:
* Multiple difficulty levels
* Multiple UI skins with more dynamic visual renditions of the maze
* Better UI for marking starting position, current position, and goal
* A menu screen where you select difficulty, UI skin, etc.
